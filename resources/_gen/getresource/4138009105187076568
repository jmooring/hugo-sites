Maybe you work as a writer, but you&#8217;re trying to break into another discipline (like UX Design or Software Engineering). A portfolio is the place to collect samples of your work and showcase the skills you have in different areas.

By providing a bug report template that covers important areas, it bridges the gap in information and enables effective bug resolution within a project, regardless of a reporter’s technical abilities.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Bug Report best practices\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When writing bug reports:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Limit bug reports to a single bug per report.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Check the existing issues to ensure the bug has not already been reported.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Try to reproduce the bug more than once, including environment setup if possible.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don’t get lost in irrelevant details.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Don’t make assumptions about why a bug occurs.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Provide as much proof of the bug as possible (logs and screenshots / video where necessary).\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>When addressing, or responding to bug reports:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Identify any gaps in the information provided that may be important in reproducing the bug.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Communicate clearly in the report so the reporter, and anyone else viewing the report can understand any further inquiry, any provided workaround, or a provided solution.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Depending on the work environment, issues may be assigned development related information. This information should be assigned by a project developer, and not necessarily a bug reporter. Potential categories of information that should be assigned by project staff include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Priority\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Weight\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Assignees\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Labels\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Any other project level data, like milestones or epics\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Content of the Bug Report template\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Title” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The title of a bug report serves as the primary means of discovering an issue. Both developers and project users often search for bug reports and issues. A descriptive title reduces the number of duplicate bug reports and allows users to find and utilize information provided in existing bug reports.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Summary” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Specific context and detail may not fit within the title of a bug report. Edge cases often arise under explicit conditions, and a summary provides context for a bug, allowing developers to group related bug reports or prioritize bugs without delving into the details.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Including an optional summary section enables reporters to quickly summarize the specific nature and conditions of a bug. A concise summary ensures that key information isn&#39;t lost when extensive detail is provided in the report.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Environment” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Bugs are often encountered in specific environments. Providing detailed information about the system environment in which a bug occurred is crucial for developers to identify the root cause. Even if reproduction is impossible, knowledge of an environment where a bug occurred can reveal key differences in operation on different systems, guiding development practices.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Steps to reproduce” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Detailing the specific steps taken to encounter the bug allows developers to identify any errors in the process or accurately reproduce the bug if the environment can be replicated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Observed behavior” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Detailing the observed behavior provides developers with an understanding of the bug&#39;s effects. Observations that may not be evident in logging or output can offer insights that assist in identifying the bug&#39;s cause. For example, if a specific step takes longer than expected, it may indicate a connection to the issue. Detailing such observations is important, while providing personal perspectives on the cause can be distracting or provide incorrect information. Manual review and acknowledgment by the reporter can provide accurate information, unlike relying solely on logs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Expected behavior” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Detailing the expected behavior of the product without the bug can be as simple as stating &quot;should not produce an error.&quot; However, for edge cases or specific product uses, the bug reporter&#39;s expectations may differ from the product&#39;s intended behavior. This disparity may indicate an issue with product documentation or the reporter&#39;s understanding. Identifying these differences early in the bug reporting process saves developers from investigating bug reports that may be rooted solely in the reporter&#39;s expectations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Proof” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Allocating space for providing proof of a bug allows reporters to provide screenshots, logs, videos, or other forms of hard evidence. Proof not only confirms the validity of a bug report but can also provide additional bug-related information beyond what the reporter can provide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Test data” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Products that require input may contain bugs that are not easily identified due to the variety of potential input. Sharing test data that led to the bug allows for accurate reproduction of the issue, simplifying the developer&#39;s process of identifying and resolving the bug.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Test data may contain sensitive information and should be redacted before reporting a bug. Reporters should be encouraged to redact the data and test it again to ensure that any provided test data still triggers the bug.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the “Additional context” section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Additional context can provide critical information for finding the root cause of a bug. Bugs may only occur under specific conditions, during certain processes, or when system resources are being consumed by other processes. The product itself may shape what additional context is desirable in a bug report. Identifying common conditions associated with increased bugs and performance issues becomes significantly easier if bug reporters know to provide context related to those conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Project information\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Depending on the platform used, issues may have additional project-related information attached. This information is directed toward project management and internal issue tracking and is not covered in this template. If a reporter is also a project maintainer, they may add this information.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some examples of project oriented information are:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Severity\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Assigned project members\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Labels\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Milestone\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Status\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Resolution\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Additional Bug Report resources\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>How to create an issue (GitHub): \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue\">https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to create an issue (GitLab): \u003Ca href=\"https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_issues.html\">https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_issues.html\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Issue templates for GitHub: \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Awesome-Repo-Template/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE\">https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Awesome-Repo-Template/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Issue templates for GitLab: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.garybell.co.uk/gitlab-issue-templates/\">https://www.garybell.co.uk/gitlab-issue-templates/\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>Explore other templates from \u003Ca href=\"https://thegooddocsproject.dev/\">The Good Docs Project\u003C/a>.

They help explain the\ncontext and components of a product or service and how these elements\nfit into a broader framework.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Why do I need a concept doc?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>A concept document is important for conveying foundational ideas or\nprocesses. The key reasons why a concept document is integral include\nthe following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Alignment and collaboration\u003C/strong>: A concept document serves as a shared point of reference for businesses and teams, holding high-level ideas and enabling all stakeholders to align their understanding and expectations. \nBy having a shared document that holds the ideas, it is much easier to communicate ideas and track progress. Having a central\ndescription of core concepts reduces repeated explanations through a document. It is much easier to have a concept document that can then be referenced when needed.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Reader comprehension\u003C/strong>: Concept documents are important because they provide foundational knowledge and background that gives readers context that will help in understanding more specific content. \nReaders can see the connections and relationships between different elements, helping them make informed decisions about your product. Decision-making is much easier to do if the reader understands the broader context.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>A concept doc presents information at the appropriate level of detail to help readers:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Proceed to other types of content, such\nas how-tos and reference, with all the foundational knowledge,\nbackground and context necessary to use the tool or system.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Make an informed decision about using certain\nfeatures of your solution and prioritize efforts throughout the\ndevelopment process.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Know how certain concepts relate to the broader\ncontext.

It also acts\nas a primer for users who are not yet ready to dive into concrete\noperations or step-by-step guides. By presenting the core concepts and principles in a\nclear and structured manner, the concept doc gradually develops the\nreader&#39;s understanding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How does the reader get to this document?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In the reader&#39;s critical user journey through documentation, a concept\ndocument is usually in the early sections. While concept documents are\ncommonly found at the beginning of documentation, they can also appear\nthroughout when introducing new concepts to provide the necessary\ncontext.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are two main options here:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Users start their journey with this document or land here from the search results.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Users get there in the middle of their journey because they stumbled upon an unknown concept. \nIn this case, the document serves as a middle layer (to make a decision about using this concept).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>Ryan Young in the talk &quot;Is it (layer) cake: Thinking in content levels&quot; calls this \napproach a layered cake (of content).

Therefore, you can present integration guides, use cases, and broad concepts on this level. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It is important to notice that users will not follow a defined flow through the documentation. \nThey may jump through different levels of content as they need to.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>They may land in your concept document by clicking a link in the How-to document prerequisites\nor by clicking a link from a related concept document.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Understanding these pathways is essential for tailoring the content to\nmeet the varying needs of users who either start their exploration with\nthe concept or arrive here as part of an ongoing information quest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Contents of the concept document\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Sections which should exist in a concept template include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>(Optional) An introductory paragraph\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Optionally, you may begin the document with an introductory paragraph\nbefore diving into the definition. This introductory paragraph can set\nthe stage, explaining the concept&#39;s relevance and importance. It\nprovides readers with a context for what they&#39;re about to learn and\nwhat they can expect in the document.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Apply the inverted pyramid technique here by starting with a high-level overview.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You may skip it and jump right into the definition section.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Giving a definition\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Define the concept so that you and your reader will have a shared\nunderstanding of the language used throughout the document.Think of it\nas a glossary definition.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is a good moment to define the scope of the concept – define its\nboundaries, what you&#39;ll cover in a document and how deep into details\nyou will dive and the extent of the details you will provide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It may be useful to define what is out of scope – what you don&#39;t mean\nby that concept and what won&#39;t be covered. If the concept has synonyms\nin other spheres or products, it may be useful to explicitly\ndisassociate from them in this section of the document to ensure a\nuniform understanding of the concept.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Provide an overview of how the concept fits into a bigger picture. This\ninvolves explaining how the concept interacts with other concepts\n\u003Ca href=\"#use-known-concepts-and-examples\">already known by your\naudience\u003C/a>, provided you\nhave knowledge of their level of understanding. Additionally, you can\nbreak down the concept into smaller, more digestible pieces. By doing\nso, you help your readers make connections, recognize patterns, and gain\na deeper understanding of the subject matter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes, concepts are explained by using\n\u003Ca href=\"#metaphors-and-analogies\">analogies\u003C/a> that the user should\nbe familiar with. For example, while explaining the complex topic of how\nelectricity goes through wires, you could relate it to a more familiar\ntopic, such as how water goes through pipes. It helps to bridge\nknowledge gaps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, when you give a definition, it may be useful to stick to\nproblem-solution or benefit-focused language.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>(Optional) A visual aid or a diagram\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Use a diagram to illustrate how the concept is organized or how it fits\ninto a broader system; a decision tree, a flow chart, or a system\noverview diagram is best suited for these tasks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Usually a concept is best explained with one diagram. This primary\ndiagram should be placed close to the top, typically under the\ndescription. Presenting the diagram early helps draw the reader in, and\nhelps them orient themselves visually.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes multiple diagrams should be used to explain different aspects\nof the concept, and these should be placed next to relevant annotations\nabout it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To enhance the clarity of a diagram illustrating a process related to the concept, \nconsider adding numbered elements within the diagram itself. \nAdditionally, including a legend positioned at the bottom of the picture can explain \nthe meaning behind each numbered component. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Diagrams are most valuable when they simplify complex relationships,\ndepict processes, or illustrate hierarchies. Be cautious not to overwhelm the document with unnecessary visuals \nif the concept is easily explained through text alone.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>(Optional) About the &quot;Background&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The background section may describe the prehistory of the concept if it\nis important for better understanding. You can provide relevant\ninformation and context that helps readers understand the following\ncontexts:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Historical background (where the idea originated from, is there any\nlegacy that made it work like that).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Industry context (any significant changes in the sector you&#39;re\nworking in that influenced the concept).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Market and technology trends, any new disruptive technologies that\nappear (Artificial Intelligence(AI)), business trends (recession, remote work), or industry\nregulations (for instance, General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>It can describe how or why something was designed or developed, what\ndecisions were made in the past and why. In addition, you can describe\nthe alternatives.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Use cases&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The use cases section is a good place to apply the StoryBrand framework (referred in the \u003Ca href=\"resources-concept.md\">Resources document\u003C/a>)\nto engage readers and add more storytelling elements. Storytelling helps\nengage users and memorize concepts by association with the story.\nResearch in neuroscience has revealed that narratives, such as those\napplied in the StoryBrand framework, engage multiple areas of the brain \nand the distinction between reading and real-life gets blurred. \nRead more regarding that in the \u003Ca href=\"resources-concept.md\">Resources document\u003C/a>. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Storybrand technique is a specific approach to storytelling that\ninvolves framing the story in terms of a protagonist who has a problem\nand needs a guide to help them solve it. The concept or solution being\npresented is positioned as the guide that can help the protagonist\novercome their challenges and achieve their goals. By framing the\nconcept in this way, the reader is more likely to engage with the story\nand see the product as a valuable solution to their problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Make your user a protagonist of the story.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Define what challenges they&#39;re facing, so you can craft a story that\nresonates with them.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Set the stage for the story. Highlight the specific problem or\nobstacle that your target audience is encountering. Make it\nrelatable and evoke empathy.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Position your concept or feature as the guide that can help the\nprotagonist overcome their challenges and achieve their goals.\nOutline the steps or key concepts that the user needs to understand\nto effectively use the product or feature.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Illustrate how the user&#39;s life or business can be transformed by\nusing a concept.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>For example, you&#39;re talking about the containerisation concept, and your\n&quot;protagonist&quot; is a system administrator in a large company, and they are\nexperiencing numerous typical problems, such as slow deployments,\ndifficulty scaling up service, or frequent power outages. So you act as\na guide and introduce the &quot;protagonist&quot; to containerised applications,\ntheir infrastructure and how various aspects of these solve the\nprotagonist&#39;s problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By following this framework, you can create a concept document that\ncaptures attention, communicates the value of your product or feature,\nand motivates readers to take action.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When using storytelling as a technique in a concept document, it&#39;s\nessential to strike a delicate balance between engaging the reader and\nensuring that the concept remains relevant and comprehensible. A common\npitfall for writers is becoming overly enthusiastic about their story,\nwhich can lead to an overload of information that might distract from\nthe core concept. Thus, as you weave a story into your concept, always\nconsider how it enhances understanding rather than overwhelming your\naudience with unnecessary details.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>(Optional) About the &quot;Comparison&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If the concept has few implementations, versions, or types, or it has a\ndirect preeceder, you may put in a comparison table. This table helps answer questions such as:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>What is the difference between this element and a similar element?\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Why do I need to choose a certain option?\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ctable>\n\u003Cthead>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Cth>What\u003C/th>\n\u003Cth>Why needed\u003C/th>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003C/thead>\n\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>{concept} type 1\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>A reason to use it\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>{concept} type 2\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>A reason to use it\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Ch3>(Optional) About the &quot;Related resources&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Provide links or references to additional resources that can help\nreaders explore the topic further or dive deeper into specific aspects\nof the concept.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you have many related links, split them into a few groups (for example, How-to&#39;s,\nLinked concepts, External materials, etc.), not more than 3-5 links\neach, to avoid overwhelming a reader with a wall of links.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Best practices for concept documents\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Within the realm of concept documents,\nthere exist dozens of valid approaches and documentation techniques.\nEach author, armed with their experience, must choose the right\ntechnique tailored to the specific demands of the task at hand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Concept documents are more than just collections of ideas; they&#39;re a careful mix of clarity and detail. \nCrafting them requires skill in both technical and narrative aspects, making it a significant challenge. \nChoosing the right technique involves navigating communication intricacies to ensure that the document resonates with\nits audience, serving as a beacon of understanding in the vast amount of\ninformation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here are the key practices for crafting an effective\nconcept document:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Scope\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The scope of your concept document is a foundational element.

The contact methods used by a business can provide insights into the user experience, which can be helpful in improving the product.

If users are still struggling, then they can receive guided assistance from the support agent.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>You can guide the user to contact the support team using the organization’s preferred communication methods, especially those methods which have enabled customer issue tracking data. As a result, the company can possibly track trends in customer issues and use this information for quarterly reviews about the customer support strategy or to reveal recurring issues in the product that are impacting several users at once.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Best practices for contact support pages\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Research your company’s support strategy: When deciding the communication channels for your company/organization’s contact support page, consider picking ones that best align with the customer support strategy.

It is recommended for organizations that offer different tiers of support for their product, such as a free and paid subscription. This information is best presented in a table.  For an example, check out the \u003Ca href=\"https://zoom.us/pricing\">Plans and Pricing table on Zoom\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Contact details&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This section of the contact support page is the most important because it is where you list the different methods for contacting a support agent. This template lists the following contact methods:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Phone number\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Text message\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Email address\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Live chat\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Social media\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Delete any contact methods that do not apply to your company. It’s best to pick the communication channels that suit your company&#39;s support strategies. When deciding the order in which you present the contact details, it should align with the customer support strategy. For more information about customer support strategies, see \u003Ca href=\"process-contact-support.md\">the Contact support process document\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, always include a statement that indicates when the customer can expect a response for each contact method. If certain communication channels are only available at specific times, indicate those times for each one.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;More support&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This section is where users go if they need more self-help with their issues. Possible options include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Slack or Discord channels\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Knowledge base\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Community forums\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Some companies might want users to choose self-help options before they contact a support agent. For example, they may encourage users to browse a knowledge base or community forum.

Test your how-to instructions from start to finish so that you can uncover omitted steps, incorrect details, steps out of order, and information gaps that block users. If it&#39;s not possible to test it yourself, have a developer or subject matter expert demonstrate the step to you and record the session, if possible.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Re-test instructions after every notable product release to ensure instructions are still accurate and work end-to-end.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Lengthy how-tos can overwhelm users. Focus only on one task in your how-to and restrict to a maximum of 8-10 steps per task.

It is essential to distinguish between an installation guide and a how-to guide document.\n​\nAn installation guide shows how to install the product (as a procedure), while a &quot;how-to&quot; topic shows how to do something with the product after it&#39;s been installed. The difference lies in the purpose of the instructions. An installation guide describes the process of setting up and configuring a specific software, application, or service. A how-to guide describes how to accomplish a particular task using a specific product or technology (which would already be installed).\n​\nThe key differences are listed in the following table:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ctable>\n\u003Cthead>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Cth>\u003C/th>\n\u003Cth>\u003Cstrong>installation guide\u003C/strong>\u003C/th>\n\u003Cth>\u003Cstrong>how-to guide\u003C/strong>\u003C/th>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003C/thead>\n\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>Audience\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>Systems administrators and users who require detailed instructions and technical details when setting-up and installing a software product.\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>Users with a less technical background who want to set-up and install a software product.\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>Scope\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>An installation guide provides specific instructions on how to install and set up a particular software product.\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>A how-to guide takes the user through a series of steps required to perform a specific task to solve a particular problem.\u003C/td>\n\u003C/tr>\n\u003Ctr>\n\u003Ctd>Format\u003C/td>\n\u003Ctd>An installation guide is a prerequisite document a user reads before considering How-to Guides; because you need the product itself installed before you solve any problem related to that product.

How you write your steps will vary depending on your organization&#39;s style guide.\nThis template breaks down the quickstart into parts. One part of the quickstart may focus on completing several related steps. You&#39;re welcome to follow this structure or use the step headings on their own.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If your quickstart involves many complex tasks, break it down into different logical parts with each part consisting of one or more related steps. For example, you can structure a quickstart guide to onboard an app as follows: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Part 1 Configure your local dev environment\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 1.1 \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 1.2\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Part 2 Build your app\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 2.1\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 2.2\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Part 3 Deploy your app \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 3.1\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 3.2\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Part 4 Test your app \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 4.1\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 4.2\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, if your quickstart does not involve many independent tasks, only add the logical steps. For example, you can  structure  a quickstart guide to create a new project in Visual Studio as follows:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 1 Create a new project\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 2 Select a template type\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Step 3 Configure your new project\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Tips for writing steps in a quickstart\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Number the steps in the format {part}.{step} as it helps your users to easily identify and locate procedures in the quickstart. Also, this helps in referencing a particular step in a lengthy quickstart.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Start the heading with a verb and express the step/part headings as a complete thought. Don&#39;t use the \u003Cem>-ing\u003C/em> form of the verb because it is harder to translate. For example, you could use the heading \u003Cstrong>Connect to the VM instance\u003C/strong> instead of \u003Cstrong>Connect\u003C/strong>.   \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>For each step, provide some background information about the task so users know what they&#39;re about to do and why.

The overall goal of a style guide is to ensure quality\nand consistency throughout the project&#39;s documentation, which is especially\nimportant if different authors are contributing to the documentation over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A style guide can provide early guidance to new contributors as they make\ndecisions related to your project&#39;s documentation. Contributors often have to\nmake subjective decisions about the documentation, such as:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Which style guide your project will defer to as its default style guide\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to refer to terms that are unique or specific to that project\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How to format certain types of content\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>What tone, attitude, or level of formality you recommend using in the project\n(usually conveyed through word choice)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Any specific rules you want to highlight for documentation contributors, such\nas language usage disputes that seem to arise periodically within the\ncommunity\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>A style guide provides your project&#39;s answers to these questions and ensures\nthat all of the contributors are working from the same common understanding.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How to make a style guide scale with your project\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>A project&#39;s style guide usually starts out as a stub at the beginning of a\nproject. For example, it might simply indicate which style guide is your\nproject&#39;s default guide, such as the Google developer documentation style guide\nor the Microsoft Style Guide. It might link to specific elements from the default\nguide that are most relevant to your project or point out any exceptions to the\ndefault guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As your project grows and matures, your style guide can grow along with it. For\nexample, debates can (and will) arise about how to refer to a specific term in\nthe documentation, such as whether to capitalize or hyphenate a term that is\nunique to the project. Once resolved, you can capture decisions in the style\nguide. Then, if that debate arises again, you can simply refer contributors to\nyour style guide rather than rehashing the same debate every time a new\ncontributor joins the project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, keep in mind that some teams consistently struggle to maintain a style\nguide over time. The guiding principle here is that a small amount of work up\nfront can save a lot more work later. It&#39;s much easier to set your standards in\na style guide early in your project&#39;s life cycle than it is to retroactively\nclean up your documentation later when the project is more mature. With small\nbut regular updates, your style guide can evolve alongside your project. It will\nhelp your contributors get up to speed quickly and start writing high quality\ndocumentation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To help your project scale, consider setting a recurring meeting or agenda item\nto review the style guide and address style guide issues on a periodic basis\n(such as once a month). Perhaps you could make someone on the team the project\nowner for the style guide to ensure someone has the responsibility to update the\nguide after style guide reviews.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Content of your style guide\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Introduction&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In this section, briefly introduce the purpose of the style guide and how\nyou intend to use this style guide in your project. Feel free to adapt this\ncontent. If desired, you can briefly elaborate on the goals or mission of your\nproject&#39;s documentation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Intended audience and scope&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Use this section to indicate who should use this style guide. Describe your\naudience for the style guide, which includes all the people who write your\ndocumentation. You will know them best. They typically will include software\nengineers, product mangers, and tech writers. You can also indicate the\nscope of the style guide if it should include more than just your project&#39;s\ndocumentation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Our preferred style guide&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Maintenance of a style guide is a lot of work. Try to do as little of it as\npossible by deferring to a more comprehensive default guide, such as the Google\ndeveloper documentation style guide or the Microsoft Style Guide. In this\nsection, you should indicate which guide is your default guide and reference the\nsource document and its version. Document any exceptions where your style guide\ndiffers from your default guide.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, if your project already has existing brand guidelines, you can link to\nthem or include them here.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Glossary of preferred terms&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Every project has its own unique terms and buzzwords and this glossary can help\nyou record your project&#39;s preferred terms. This word list provides a list of\nspecific terms that are either common word choice problems or which are unique\nto your project. As a word of caution, try to minimize jargon and buzzwords.\nAlso, avoid creating too many project-specific terms. Where possible, use the\nterms that are standard for your industry to avoid confusion. Ideally, you can\ninherit or defer to term definitions from a more authoritative glossary source.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This section includes a table to highlight terms that are unique to your project,\nor which conflict with your default style guide. For example, the Google\ndeveloper documentation guide uses &quot;open source&quot; but our project prefers\n&quot;open-source&quot; when used as an adjective, as in &quot;open-source software.&quot;\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Topic types and templates&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Good Docs project provides templates for various types of topics that you\ncan adopt in your project. Depending on the type of project you&#39;re creating,\nsome of the Good Docs templates will be more relevant than others. In this\nsection, you can link to the templates you have adopted for your project. You\ncan also explain when contributors should use these templates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;General writing tips&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This section is optional. You can link to your favorite general writing tips or\nadd some of your own general guidelines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Accessible writing&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In this section, you can link to your preferred style guides about accessible\nwriting or add some of your own general guidelines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Inclusive and bias-free writing&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In this section, you can link to your favorite resources about inclusive and\nbias-free writing or add some of your own general guidelines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Using linters&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This section is optional. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/tools/testing/#style-guide-checking-and-linting\">Linters\u003C/a>\nare tools that analyze text content to flag common mistakes such as stylistic\nerrors and suspicious constructs. An example of a linter would be a tool like\nGrammarly that processes your text and provides suggestions as you write to\nimprove the spelling and grammatical structure of the text.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Linters can be used during the editorial process within a text editor and as a\npost-processing test of the content when the document is pushed into a revision\nmanagement system as part of an automated continuous integration (CI) cycle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you want to take your style guide to the next level, you could adopt a linter\nto enforce your style guide and empower your content creators to make better\ndocumentation with less cognitive overhead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For resources and examples of linters, see:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Ca href=\"https://atom.io/packages/linter-google-styleguide\">The \u003Ccode>linter-google-styleguide\u003C/code> package for the Atom text editor\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A tool like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/tools/testing/#vale\">Vale\u003C/a>,\nwhich can automate \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/errata-ai/styles\">several popular styles\u003C/a>\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The \u003Ca href=\"https://alexjs.com/\">Alex\u003C/a> linter can check for insensitive and\ninconsiderate writing.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;How the style guide is updated&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Indicate here how frequently your style guide is reviewed, who owns the style\nguide, and how contributors can provide feedback on your style guide. For\nexample, you could provide the contact information for the group or individual\nwho owns the style guide. You could also indicate when the style guide is\nreviewed in project meetings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If this section is small enough, you can combine it with the following sections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Revision history&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This section is optional. You can use this section to provide a changelog or\ndecision log of changes to your project&#39;s style guide. You can also link out to\nother project documents that contain your decision log. You could also use this\nsection to provide guidelines about how to request changes to the style guide\nand outline how often decisions can be revisited (such as after a year).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To choose the edition number for the style guide, consider using the\nMajor.Minor.Patch numbering system outlined in\n\u003Ca href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning 2.0.0\u003C/a>. When these\nguidelines are applied to documents, you typically use 0.1 through 0.9 for\ndrafts. After the first release of the document, switch to 1.0. For major\nrevisions, increase the version by a full numeral such as 2.0. For minor\nrevisions, add a decimal, such as 1.1.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>About the &quot;Decision log&quot; section\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>This section is optional. Various project managers, sponsors, and teams make a\nlot of decisions while working on a project long-term. A decision log can track\nthe decisions you&#39;ve agreed upon.

Start with a verb.}\n\n   {Optional: Explanatory text}\n\n   {Optional: Code sample or screenshot that helps your users complete this step}\n\n   {Optional: Result}\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>The first element is the step itself, like &quot;Enter a name for your new repository.&quot; When writing steps, keep these tips in mind:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Start with an imperative verb. For example, &quot;connect&quot;, &quot;set up&quot;, or &quot;arrange.&quot; Don&#39;t use the \u003Cem>-ing\u003C/em> form of the verb because it is harder to translate.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Express steps as a complete thought. Instead of saying, &quot;Set up access&quot;, you might say, &quot;Set up access to a Cloud Storage bucket.&quot;\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Next, you may choose to add some additional information about the step. Continuing with the example, you might provide some best practices for creating memorable repository names.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Optionally, you can add a code sample or screenshot after the explanatory text, depending on the type of tutorial you&#39;re writing. Screenshots are a great way to show specific parts of the screen you are referring to in a step. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you&#39;re including code samples in your repository, make sure to add comments to your code to help learners understand what each part of the code does. Additionally, make sure your code samples work, as learners will copy and paste your code to use in their own projects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The last, and optional, element in a step, is the result. Continuing with the example, you might describe what happens after a user clicks the &quot;Create repository&quot; button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here is an example step:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>1. Enter a name for your new repository.   \n\n   Good repository names are short and self-explanatory. Avoid repository names with three or more words.\n   \n   After you click &quot;Create repository&quot;, GitHub creates your repository and the main page for the repository is displayed.\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>If needed, you can add substeps below a primary step. Make sure to indent the substep one tab space over if you&#39;re using Markdown:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode>1. Create a new pull request.\n\n   a. Navigate to the main page of your repository. \n\n   b. Under your repository name, click **Pull requests**.\n\n      By default, all open pull requests are displayed.\n\n   c. ....\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003Cp>If you&#39;re including code samples in your steps, make sure they are also indented correctly:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Set your Git username for your repository. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can change the name that is associated with your Git commits using the \u003Ccode>git config\u003C/code> command.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cpre>\u003Ccode class=\"language-bash\">git config user.name &quot;Dakota Everson&quot;\n\u003C/code>\u003C/pre>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Ch4>Tips for writing steps\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Here are some more tips to follow when writing procedural steps:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Remember to orient your users when guiding them through each step. If they need to open a particular file or dialog to complete the task, provide that information first.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Avoid writing procedures that are more than seven primary steps long.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Aim for no more than four substeps in any primary step.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Summary&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In the summary section, you can list the knowledge and skills your users have gained by completing your tutorial. Try to avoid repeating the learning objectives you listed in the overview section word for word. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, if one of your learning objectives is &quot;define components in React&quot;, you might specify \u003Cem>what\u003C/em> your users learned about defining components in React. Did they learn how to build different types of components? Or did they learn about all required functions needed to build a component? Think about some of the most important skills they gained and list them here. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Listing the actual skills and knowledge your users gained can also help to motivate your users to continue using your product, or try other tutorials. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>About the &quot;Next Steps&quot; section\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Use this section to include links to other tutorials, such as tutorials that allow users to learn about related features. You can also include links to relevant resources, like articles, blogs, or videos.\u003C/p>\n"}]}}({},{},{},{},{},{},{},{},{})),"uses":{}},{"type":"data","data":{html:"\u003Cdiv class=\"paragraph\">\n\u003Cp>At The Good Docs Project, we know you want to provide your users with information to easily use and understand your software.\nAnd you know that good documentation is the key to helping people to understand products quickly and efficiently.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"paragraph\">\n\u003Cp>But how do you create awesome documentation?\nWhere do you start, and how do you ensure your docs are the best possible quality?\nWe understand feeling overwhelmed while staring at the blank page.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"paragraph\">\n\u003Cp>We believe everyone deserves to read good documentation and that everyone should be empowered to write good documentation.\nThat&#8217;s why our community of technical writers created a full suite of templates to guide you and your team through the process of creating great documentation.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"paragraph\">\n\u003Cp>Here&#8217;s how it works:\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"ulist\">\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Browse our template packs\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Find a template that matches your use case\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>Start filling it in\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Cdiv class=\"paragraph\">\n\u003Cp>It&#8217;s that easy!\nStart using our free templates today, so you can write docs that your team is proud of and that your users will love.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>",attributes:{"attribute-undefined":"drop-line","attribute-missing":"skip","appendix-caption":"Appendix","appendix-refsig":"Appendix","caution-caption":"Caution","chapter-refsig":"Chapter","example-caption":"Example","figure-caption":"Figure","important-caption":"Important","last-update-label":"Last updated","note-caption":"Note","part-refsig":"Part",prewrap:"",sectids:"","section-refsig":"Section","table-caption":"Table","tip-caption":"Tip","toc-placement":"auto","toc-title":"Table of Contents","untitled-label":"Untitled","version-label":"Version","warning-caption":"Warning",notitle:"",icons:"font","allow-uri-read":"",sectanchors:true,"skip-front-matter":true,embedded:"",asciidoctor:"","asciidoctor-version":"2.0.20","safe-mode-name":"unsafe","safe-mode-unsafe":"","safe-mode-level":0,"max-include-depth":64,docdir:"/opt/build/repo","user-home":"/opt/buildhome",doctype:"article",htmlsyntax:"html","backend-html5-doctype-article":"","doctype-article":"","backend-html5":"",backend:"html5",outfilesuffix:".html",filetype:"html","filetype-html":"","basebackend-html-doctype-article":"","basebackend-html":"",basebackend:"html",stylesdir:".",iconsdir:"./images/icons",localdate:"2024-06-18",localyear:"2024",localtime:"00:30:22 UTC",localdatetime:"2024-06-18 00:30:22 UTC",docdate:"2024-06-18",docyear:"2024",doctime:"00:30:22 UTC",docdatetime:"2024-06-18 00:30:22 UTC","front-matter":"title: \"The Good Docs Project\"\nlayout: blocks\nblocks:\n  - block_ref: 'hero'\n    title: You have great software, but how do you explain it to the world?\n    subtitle: Our templates help you create quality documentation faster and easier.\n    video:\n      filename: home_page_video.mp4\n      alt: Happy people writing docs.\n    image:\n      filename:\n      alt:\n    cta_top:\n      text: See the \"Eko\" release v1.2.0 of our Templates!\n      link: https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/releases/v1.2.0\n      link_text: View Release\n    ctas:\n      - link: https://gitlab.com/tgdp/templates/-/releases/v1.2.0\n        link_text: Show me the templates\n        button: true\n  - block_ref: 'announce'\n    title: Everything we offer is open source, at no cost to you.\n    subtitle: The Good Docs Project is a large, global community of volunteers who are passionate about empowering developers to create good documentation.\n  - block_ref: 'split_with_image'\n    toptitle: Leverage our shared expertise\n    title: Your software is amazing, but what if nobody can use it?\n    text: Your docs could help, but where will you find the time to write docs when you're too busy solving problems with code?
