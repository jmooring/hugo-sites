Why SOS?
<a href=#why-sos>
<span class="icon hashlink">
<i class="fas fa-link"></i>
</span>
</a>
</h1>
<p>SOS rewards a very broad range of improvements that proactively harden critical open source projects and supporting infrastructure against application and supply chain attacks. To complement existing programs that reward vulnerability management, SOS’s scope is comparatively wider in the type of work it rewards, in order to support project developers.</p>

<i class="fas fa-link"></i>
</span>
</a>
</h1>
<p>Since there is no one definition of what makes an open source project critical, our selection process will be holistic. During submission evaluation we will consider the guidelines established by the <a href=https://www.nist.gov/document/white-paper-critical-software-enhancing-security-software-supply-chain target=_blank rel=noopener>National Institute of Standards and Technology’s definition</a> in response to the recent <a href=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Executive Order on Cybersecurity</a> along with criteria listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The impact of the project:</strong>
<ul>
<li>How many and what types of users will be affected by the security improvements?</li>
<li>Will the improvements have a significant impact on infrastructure and user security?</li>
<li>If the project were compromised, how serious or wide-reaching would the implications be?<br><br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The project’s rankings in existing open source criticality research:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is the project included in the <a href=https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/programs/census-program-ii/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Harvard 2 Census Study</a> of most-used packages, or is it in the top 500 packages as ranked by the <a href=https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score target=_blank rel=noopener>OpenSSF Criticality Score project</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We will consider applications on an individual basis, so even if your project doesn&rsquo;t meet all the criteria, we still encourage you to apply and provide your own criticality justification.</p>

What security improvements qualify?
<a href=#what-security-improvements-qualify>
<span class="icon hashlink">
<i class="fas fa-link"></i>
</span>
</a>
</h1>
<p>The program is initially focused on rewarding the following work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Software supply chain security improvements including hardening CI/CD pipelines and distribution infrastructure. The <a href=https://slsa.dev/ target=_blank rel=noopener>SLSA</a> framework suggests specific requirements to consider, such as basic provenance generation and verification.</li>
<li>Adoption of software artifact signing and verification. One option to consider is Sigstore&rsquo;s set of utilities (e.g. <a href=https://github.com/sigstore/cosign target=_blank rel=noopener>cosign</a>).</li>
<li>Project improvements that produce higher <a href=https://github.com/ossf/scorecard target=_blank rel=noopener>OpenSSF Scorecard</a> results. For example, a contributor can follow remediation suggestions for the following Scorecard checks:
<ul>
<li><code>Code-Review</code></li>
<li><code>Branch-Protection</code></li>
<li><code>Pinned-Dependencies</code></li>
<li><code>Dependency-Update-Tool</code></li>
<li><code>Fuzzing</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use of <a href=https://github.com/ossf/allstar target=_blank rel=noopener>OpenSSF Allstar</a> and remediation of discovered issues.</li>
<li>Earning a <a href=https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>CII Best Practice Badge</a> (which also improves the Scorecard results).</li>
<li>Adoption of SLSA builders at level 3 and above, e.g., using the <a href=https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator target=_blank rel=noopener>SLSA GitHub generator project</a>.</li>
<li>Fixing issues discovered by OSS-Fuzz that exceeded disclosure timeline: <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security%20label%3ADeadline-Exceeded%20-label%3AStability-UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer%20label%3Areproducible&can=2" target=_blank rel=noopener>all open OSS-Fuzz findings</a>. You will be rewarded based on the impact of the fix, rather than the effort. A small change that fixes a significant vulnerability in a critical project may be rewarded more significantly than a large change with minimal impact to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll continue adding to the above list, so check our <a href=#frequently-asked-questions>FAQ</a> for updates. You may also submit improvements not listed above, if you provide justification and evidence to help us understand the complexity and impact of the work.</p>
<p>Only work completed after October 1, 2021 qualifies for SOS rewards.</p>
<p>Upfront funding is available on a limited case by case basis for impactful improvements of moderate to high complexity over a longer time span. Such requests should explain why funding is required upfront and provide a detailed plan of how the improvements will be landed.</p>

<p>The SOS program is part of a broader effort to address a growing truth: the world relies on open source software, but widespread support and financial contributions are necessary to keep that software safe and secure. This $1 million investment is just the beginning—we envision the SOS pilot program as the starting point for future efforts that will hopefully bring together other large organizations and turn it into a sustainable, long-term initiative under the OpenSSF. We welcome <a href="mailto:sos-rewards@googlegroups.com?subject=[SOS]%20Feedback%20from%20sos.dev">community feedback</a> and interest from others who want to contribute to the SOS program. Together we can pool our support to give back to the open source community that makes the modern internet possible.</p>

<div class=faq-answer>A: If your organization is interested in supporting SOS through a donation, please <a href=mailto:sos-rewards-donate@googlegroups.com>reach out to us</a>. Linux Foundation membership is not required.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: What if maintainers don’t accept my changes?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: Only changes that have been accepted by the maintainers qualify for SOS rewards.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: Can vendors participate?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: Yes.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: When will I receive my award? How will it be paid out?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: We will evaluate submissions on a rolling basis and notify successful applicants as soon as possible. The awards will be paid out through the Linux Foundation Crowdfunding platform.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: Will award winners be announced publicly, or can I choose to remain anonymous?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: If you are chosen for an award, we will need your contact details in order to pay you. At this time, though, rewards will not be announced publicly.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: I’d like to suggest a larger improvement for advance funding. How will you choose between applicants if someone else proposes the same improvement?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: Collaboration is an integral part of open source development and is particularly encouraged for submissions that require advance funding, as it increases the likehood of success. All other things being equal, submissions that demonstrate better overall preparedness to land the improvements are more likely to be selected.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: Can I make multiple submissions?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: Yes, multiple submissions are allowed, but we encourage improvements to be done in larger batches when possible. For example, it is to your benefit to improve all Scorecards checks before submission, rather than making multiple submissions with improvements to individual Scorecards checks.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: Who is on the panel evaluating SOS submissions?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: The panel will initially consist of representatives from the Linux Foundation and Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST). In the future, we plan to extend panel membership to other organizations.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: When will you stop accepting submissions for the pilot round of awards? Is there a deadline for full consideration?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: There's currently no deadline for submissions.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: Is there anyone who is not eligible for an award?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: We are unable to issue rewards to individuals who are on sanctions lists, or who are in countries (e.g. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) on sanctions lists. There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon your local law. Employees of companies represented on the SOS award panel, as well as employees of the Open Source Security Foundation and Linux Foundation, are also ineligible.</div>
</div>
<div class=faq-entry>
<div class=faq-question>Q: How is SOS different from a bug bounty or vulnerability rewards program?</div>
<div class=faq-answer>A: SOS rewards project-wide improvements and the implementation of open source security best practices. It is not a bug bounty program and does not reward reports of specific project vulnerabilities. Any vulnerabilities found in a project should be reported according to the project's security disclosure policy, not through this program.</div>
